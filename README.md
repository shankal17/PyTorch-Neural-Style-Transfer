# PyTorch-Neural-Style-Trasfer

## Getting Started

Once you have the code, set up a virtual environment if you would like and install the necessary libraries by running the command below.
```bat
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

From there, just open [Example.ipynb](https://github.com/shankal17/PyTorch-Neural-Style-Transfer/blob/main/Example.ipynb) and use your own content and style images!
